# Findings

Measurements taken **in this repository**. Results carried over from the predecessor
prototype live in the build plan's **Appendix A** — they are not duplicated here, because
two copies of a number drift apart.

Every entry needs: what changed, control vs treatment with n, the conditions (model,
quantisation, hardware, other models resident), and what would change your mind. See
[README.md](README.md) for the rule.

## Inherited, unresolved — carry these forward

Open questions the prototype could not close. Whoever addresses one should record the
answer here.

### Latency differs between Unity and standalone scripts, unexplained

The same model measured **~1.31 s** mean latency inside Unity (while URP rendered a
180-prop scene) but **~3.1–3.5 s** from standalone Python hitting the same Ollama server
on the same machine, with the model correctly unloaded and reloaded between runs. That is
backwards from expectation — Unity should be the *more* contended environment.

Never root-caused. Until it is, treat *relative* comparisons within one environment as
valid and be sceptical of absolute latency numbers quoted across environments.

### Every accuracy number was measured through Ollama's HTTP API

Appendix A's results all came via Ollama. Once the in-process provider exists
(build plan Phase 6b), the same eval set must be re-run through it. Constrained decoding
goes through a different path there — GBNF supplied directly rather than a JSON Schema
compiled by Ollama — so the numbers do not automatically transfer.

### Statistical power

The prototype's eval set was n=53 with a single annotator. Differences under ~10 points
were not detectable. Building the 200+ prompt, multi-annotator set is Phase 4 and gates
the credibility of everything measured afterwards.
