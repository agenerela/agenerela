# Changelog

All notable changes to this package are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
this package uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

While the version stays `0.x`, the public API may change in any release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `ILLMProvider` and its supporting types (`ProviderCapabilities`, `SchemaDialect`,
  `RateLimit`, `DecisionRequest`, `ProviderResult`) in `Agenerela.Providers` — the contract
  every backend satisfies, defined before any of them is written so that Ollama, cloud APIs
  and in-process inference are implementations rather than framework edits. No
  implementation yet; `DecisionRequest.Schema` lands with `DecisionSchema`.
- `Documentation~/providers.md`: how each planned backend answers the contract, what a
  second cloud vendor would need, and which parts are deliberately still open.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- Package skeleton: runtime, editor and editor-test assembly definitions.
- `AgenerelaInfo` with package name and version constants.
- Smoke tests asserting the assemblies resolve and are visible to the test runner.
